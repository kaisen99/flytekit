# Internal Utilities

The `flytekit` SDK leverages a suite of internal utilities to manage asynchronous operations, enforce rate limits, facilitate object tracking, implement local caching, and provide robust data modeling. These components are crucial for the SDK's performance, reliability, and seamless interaction with the Flyte platform.

## Asynchronous Execution Management

The asynchronous execution management components provide a robust mechanism for executing asynchronous code within a synchronous context, crucial for `flytekit`'s mixed execution environments.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Background Thread Execution**: The `_TaskRunner` class manages an `asyncio` event loop on a dedicated background thread. This allows `flytekit` to run coroutines without blocking the main thread, which is often synchronous.
*   **Synchronous-to-Asynchronous Bridge**: The `_AsyncLoopManager` provides `run_sync` and `synced` methods.
    *   `run_sync(coro_func, *args, **kwargs)`: Executes an asynchronous function (`coro_func`) synchronously by running its coroutine on a background event loop. This is ideal for integrating async I/O operations (e.g., network calls to the Flyte Admin service) into synchronous `flytekit` components.
    *   `synced(coro_func)`: A decorator that transforms an asynchronous function into a synchronous one, internally using `run_sync`. This simplifies the integration of async functions into existing synchronous code paths.
*   **Thread-Specific Event Loops**: The `_AsyncLoopManager` maintains a map of `_TaskRunner` instances, keyed by the current thread's name and process ID. This ensures that each thread requiring async capabilities gets its own isolated event loop, preventing conflicts and improving concurrency.
*   **Exception Handling**: `_TaskRunner` includes a custom exception handler for its event loop, logging errors that occur within background coroutines.

### Practical Implementation

When `flytekit` needs to perform an operation that is inherently asynchronous (e.g., fetching data from a remote service, interacting with a database via an async driver) but is called from a synchronous part of the SDK (like a task execution engine), the `_AsyncLoopManager` is used.

For example, if a synchronous task needs to make an API call that returns a coroutine, `run_sync` ensures that the coroutine is executed to completion on a background thread, and its result is returned to the calling synchronous context.

```python
from flytekit.utils.asyn import _AsyncLoopManager

# Assume some_async_function is an async def function
async def some_async_function(data):
    # ... perform async operations ...
    return f"processed_{data}"

# In a synchronous context:
loop_manager = _AsyncLoopManager()
result = loop_manager.run_sync(some_async_function, "input_data")
print(result) # Output: processed_input_data

# Using the decorator:
@loop_manager.synced
async def another_async_function(x):
    return x * 2

sync_result = another_async_function(5)
print(sync_result) # Output: 10
```

### Important Considerations

*   **Resource Management**: The `_AsyncLoopManager` issues a warning if more than 500 event loop runners are created, indicating a potential for runaway recursion or excessive resource consumption. Proper design should minimize the number of distinct threads requiring dedicated event loops.
*   **Thread Safety**: While `_TaskRunner` and `_AsyncLoopManager` handle thread safety for their internal operations, developers must ensure that any shared resources accessed by coroutines running on these background threads are themselves thread-safe.

## Rate Limiting

The rate limiting utility provides a mechanism to control the frequency of operations, preventing excessive requests to external services.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Requests Per Minute (RPM) Control**: The `RateLimiter` class enforces a configurable RPM limit.
*   **Asynchronous and Synchronous Acquisition**: It offers both `acquire` (an `async` method) and `sync_acquire` (a synchronous wrapper) to request permission to proceed with an operation. If the rate limit is exceeded, the caller is blocked until capacity becomes available.
*   **Queue-Based Management**: Internally, a `deque` stores timestamps of recent requests, allowing the limiter to efficiently track and enforce the RPM.
*   **Configurable Delay**: The delay calculation ensures that the rate limit is strictly adhered to, pausing execution for the necessary duration.

### Practical Implementation

This utility is typically used when `flytekit` interacts with external APIs or services that have rate limits, such as the Flyte Admin service. By wrapping API calls with the rate limiter, `flytekit` can prevent itself from being throttled or blocked.

```python
from flytekit.utils.rate_limiter import RateLimiter
from flytekit.utils.asyn import _AsyncLoopManager
import time

# Create a rate limiter allowing 2 requests per minute
limiter = RateLimiter(rpm=2)
loop_manager = _AsyncLoopManager()

# Synchronous usage
print(f"Sync acquire 1 at {time.time()}")
limiter.sync_acquire()
print(f"Sync acquired 1 at {time.time()}")

print(f"Sync acquire 2 at {time.time()}")
limiter.sync_acquire()
print(f"Sync acquired 2 at {time.time()}")

# The third acquire will block for approximately 60 seconds
print(f"Sync acquire 3 at {time.time()}")
limiter.sync_acquire()
print(f"Sync acquired 3 at {time.time()}")

# Asynchronous usage (requires an event loop)
async def make_limited_call(call_num):
    print(f"Async acquire {call_num} at {time.time()}")
    await limiter.acquire()
    print(f"Async acquired {call_num} at {time.time()}")

# Run async calls using the loop manager
loop_manager.run_sync(make_limited_call, 1)
loop_manager.run_sync(make_limited_call, 2)
loop_manager.run_sync(make_limited_call, 3)
```

### Important Considerations

*   **RPM Range**: The `RateLimiter` currently enforces an RPM between 1 and 100. Values outside this range will raise a `ValueError`.
*   **Concurrency**: The `asyncio.Semaphore` ensures that concurrent asynchronous calls respect the rate limit.

## Object Hashing and Tracking

These utilities enable `flytekit` to introspect and track the origin and identity of Python objects, which is vital for features like caching and dynamic task resolution.

### Object Hashing

*   **`HashOnReferenceMixin`**: Provides a `__hash__` implementation that uses the object's memory address (`id(self)`). This is useful for objects where content-based hashing is not feasible or where identity (not value) is the primary concern for uniqueness.
*   **`HashMethod`**: A generic wrapper for a callable that calculates a string hash for an object. This allows for custom hashing logic to be applied consistently.

### Object Tracking

*   **`InstanceTrackingMeta`**: This metaclass automatically records the Python module and file path where an instance of a class is created. It specifically handles cases where modules are run as `__main__` or imported from files.
*   **`TrackedInstance`**: A base class that uses `InstanceTrackingMeta`. Instances of `TrackedInstance` automatically gain `instantiated_in` (the module name) and `_module_file` (the file path) properties.
    *   **`find_lhs()`**: Attempts to determine the variable name (Left-Hand Side) to which the instance was assigned in its originating module. This is crucial for `flytekit` to locate and reference objects during serialization and execution.
*   **`FlyteTrackedABC`**: A specialized metaclass that resolves the common Python "metaclass conflict" when a class needs to inherit from both `abc.ABC` (for abstract base class behavior) and `TrackedInstance` (for object tracking).
*   **`_ModuleSanitizer`**: A utility to resolve the absolute module path of a Python file, even when dealing with complex import scenarios or Jupyter notebooks.

### Practical Implementation

Object tracking is fundamental for `flytekit`'s ability to serialize and register tasks and workflows. For example:

*   **Non-function Tasks**: For tasks defined as class instances (e.g., `flytekit.extras.sqlite3.task.SQLite3Task`), `TrackedInstance` helps `flytekit` determine their unique name and location for registration.
*   **Task Resolvers**: When custom task resolvers are used, `TrackedInstance` enables `flytekit` to find the assigned variable name of the resolver instance, which is necessary for the Flyte engine to locate and use it at runtime.

```python
from flytekit.core.tracker import TrackedInstance
import inspect

class MyTrackedObject(TrackedInstance):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name

# When an instance is created, its origin is tracked
my_obj = MyTrackedObject("example")

# Accessing tracked properties
print(f"Object instantiated in module: {my_obj.instantiated_in}")
print(f"Object defined as variable: {my_obj.lhs}") # This will attempt to find 'my_obj'
```

### Important Considerations

*   **Dynamic Object Creation**: `find_lhs` relies on inspecting the module's global namespace. If objects are created dynamically (e.g., within loops or functions that don't assign them to top-level module variables), `find_lhs` might fail or return unexpected results.
*   **Metaclass Conflicts**: `FlyteTrackedABC` specifically addresses a common Python issue, ensuring that `flytekit`'s internal classes can combine abstract behavior with instance tracking.

## Local Caching

The local caching utility provides a persistent store for the results of local task executions, significantly speeding up iterative development.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Persistent Storage**: `LocalTaskCache` stores task execution results on the local filesystem, allowing them to persist across Python interpreter sessions.
*   **Cache Key Generation**: Results are cached based on a key derived from the task name, cache version, and a hash of the input literal map. This ensures that only identical task invocations (with the same inputs and cache version) retrieve cached results.
*   **Input Variable Exclusion**: The `cache_ignore_input_vars` parameter allows specific input variables to be excluded from the cache key calculation. This is useful for inputs that do not affect the task's output (e.g., timestamps, run IDs).
*   **Serialization Handling**: The cache handles the serialization and deserialization of `ModelLiteralMap` objects, converting them to and from protobuf bytes for storage. It also supports older `ModelLiteralMap` objects directly.
*   **Cache Management**: Provides `initialize()` to set up the cache and `clear()` to invalidate all cached entries.

### Practical Implementation

During local execution of Flyte workflows, if a task is marked as cacheable and its inputs match a previously cached run, `LocalTaskCache` retrieves the results directly, bypassing re-execution. This is invaluable for debugging and rapid iteration.

```python
from flytekit.core.local_cache import LocalTaskCache
from flytekit.models.literals import LiteralMap, Literal, Scalar, Primitive
from flytekit.models.types import SimpleType

# Example ModelLiteralMap
input_map = LiteralMap(literals={
    "x": Literal(scalar=Scalar(primitive=Primitive(integer=10))),
    "y": Literal(scalar=Scalar(primitive=Primitive(string_value="hello")))
})
output_map = LiteralMap(literals={
    "result": Literal(scalar=Scalar(primitive=Primitive(integer=20)))
})

task_name = "my_cached_task"
cache_version = "v1"
ignore_vars = ("y",) # Ignore 'y' for cache key calculation

# Store a result
LocalTaskCache.set(task_name, cache_version, input_map, ignore_vars, output_map)
print("Result stored in cache.")

# Retrieve the result
retrieved_output = LocalTaskCache.get(task_name, cache_version, input_map, ignore_vars)
if retrieved_output:
    print(f"Retrieved from cache: {retrieved_output.literals['result'].scalar.primitive.integer}")
else:
    print("Not found in cache.")

# Clear the cache
LocalTaskCache.clear()
print("Cache cleared.")
```

### Important Considerations

*   **Cache Invalidation**: Changing the `cache_version` or the task's inputs (unless ignored) will result in a cache miss.
*   **Data Consistency**: The cache stores serialized protobufs. While `flytekit` handles conversion, ensure that the underlying data types remain compatible across versions if relying on long-term caching.
*   **Pickling Compatibility**: The local cache relies on pickling for some internal state, which can sometimes lead to compatibility issues across different `flytekit` versions if not managed carefully.

## File System Abstraction

The file system abstraction provides a consistent interface for local file operations, particularly addressing cross-platform compatibility.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Windows Path Compatibility**: The `FlyteLocalFileSystem` class, derived from `fsspec.implementations.local.LocalFileSystem`, overrides the path separator (`sep`) to use `os.sep`. This ensures that file paths are correctly handled on Windows systems, where the separator is `\` instead of `/`.

### Practical Implementation

This utility is used internally by `flytekit` whenever it needs to interact with the local filesystem in a way that is robust across different operating systems. This includes reading and writing intermediate data, managing local cache files, and handling input/output artifacts during local execution.

```python
from flytekit.core.local_fsspec import FlyteLocalFileSystem
import os

# Instantiate the FlyteLocalFileSystem
fs = FlyteLocalFileSystem()

# The separator will be correct for the current OS
print(f"File system separator: {fs.sep}")
print(f"OS separator: {os.sep}")

# Example usage (conceptual, as fsspec methods are not shown in snippet)
# fs.open("path/to/file.txt", "w").write("Hello")
```

### Important Considerations

*   **`fsspec` Dependency**: This utility relies on the `fsspec` library for its core functionality.

## Metrics and Statistics

These components provide a flexible and extensible framework for emitting operational metrics within `flytekit`, supporting both real and mock statistical backends.

### Core Capabilities

*   **`ScopeableStatsProxy`**: This is a foundational proxy class that allows for hierarchical metric naming. When a new scope is created using `get_stats(name)`, subsequent metric calls on the new proxy will automatically prefix the metric name with the scope.
    *   **Metric Types**: Supports common metric types like `incr` (increment counter), `decr` (decrement counter), `timing` (record duration), `timer` (context manager for timing), and `gauge` (set a value).
    *   **Tag Serialization**: Automatically serializes tags into the metric name for compatibility with statsd-like systems, handling forbidden characters and ensuring ASCII compatibility.
*   **`StatsClientProxy`**: A direct implementation of `ScopeableStatsProxy`.
*   **`TaggableStats`**: Extends `ScopeableStatsProxy` to allow for global tags to be associated with a stats client. These tags are automatically applied to all metrics emitted through that client. It also provides `clear_tags()` and `extend_tags()` for dynamic tag management.
*   **`DummyStatsClient`**: A no-operation (no-op) implementation of a statsd client. It inherits from `statsd.StatsClient` but overrides the `_send` method to do nothing.

### Practical Implementation

`flytekit` uses these utilities to emit metrics about its internal operations, such as task execution times, resource usage, and error rates.

*   **Production Environments**: In deployed environments, `TaggableStats` (backed by a real statsd client) is used to send metrics to a monitoring system, allowing operators to observe the health and performance of `flytekit` components.
*   **Development and Testing**: During local development or in unit tests, `DummyStatsClient` and `MockStats` are used.
    *   `DummyStatsClient` prevents actual network calls for metrics, making tests faster and isolated.
    *   `MockStats` (from `flytekit.core.mock_stats`) allows tests to assert that specific metrics were emitted with expected values and tags, verifying the correct instrumentation of the code.

```python
from flytekit.interfaces.stats.taggable import TaggableStats
from flytekit.interfaces.stats.client import DummyStatsClient
from flytekit.core.mock_stats import MockStats

# Example with DummyStatsClient (no actual metrics sent)
dummy_client = DummyStatsClient()
stats = TaggableStats(dummy_client, full_prefix="flytekit.sdk")
scoped_stats = stats.get_stats("task_execution")

scoped_stats.incr("successful_runs")
scoped_stats.gauge("memory_usage_mb", 1024)

with scoped_stats.timer("task_duration"):
    # Simulate some work
    import time
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Example with MockStats (for testing assertions)
mock_stats = MockStats(scope="flytekit.sdk")
mock_scoped_stats = mock_stats.get_stats("task_execution")

mock_scoped_stats.incr("successful_runs", tags={"task_type": "python"})
mock_scoped_stats.gauge("cpu_utilization", 0.75)

print(f"Mock stats records: {mock_stats._records}")
print(f"Mock stats tags: {mock_stats._records_tags}")
```

### Important Considerations

*   **Performance Overhead**: While the `DummyStatsClient` has minimal overhead, using a real statsd client will introduce some performance cost due to network communication.
*   **Tagging Best Practices**: Use tags judiciously to avoid cardinality explosion in monitoring systems. `TaggableStats` provides a flexible way to manage tags, but it's important to define a consistent tagging strategy.

## Lazy Module Loading

The lazy module loading utility helps manage optional dependencies, improving startup time and reducing installation requirements for core `flytekit` functionality.

### Core Capabilities

*   **`_LazyModule`**: This custom module type acts as a placeholder for modules that are not immediately required. If any attribute of a `_LazyModule` instance is accessed, it raises an `ImportError`, clearly indicating that the underlying module is not installed.

### Practical Implementation

`flytekit` uses `_LazyModule` for its "extras" or optional integrations (e.g., integrations with specific machine learning frameworks or databases). This allows users to install only the core `flytekit` package and then install additional dependencies only if they need specific features.

```python
from flytekit.lazy_import.lazy_module import _LazyModule

# Example: Simulate an optional module that might not be installed
# In flytekit, this would be done via a helper function like lazy_import
optional_module = _LazyModule("my_optional_dependency")

try:
    # Accessing an attribute will raise ImportError if the module isn't truly loaded
    optional_module.some_function()
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ImportError: {e}")
```

### Important Considerations

*   **Clear Error Messages**: The primary benefit is providing a clear `ImportError` message that tells the user which module is missing, rather than a generic `AttributeError` or `NameError`.
*   **Runtime Dependency Check**: Dependencies are checked at runtime when the module is first accessed, not at import time.

## Flyte Data Models

The `flytekit.models` package contains the Python representations of the core data structures used by the Flyte platform. These models define the contract for how tasks, workflows, executions, types, and other entities are structured and communicated between the `flytekit` SDK, the Flyte Admin service, and the Flyte Propeller engine.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Protobuf Serialization/Deserialization**: All model classes inherit from `FlyteIdlEntity` and provide `to_flyte_idl()` and `from_flyte_idl()` methods. These methods enable seamless conversion between Python objects and their corresponding Flyte IDL (protobuf) representations. This is fundamental for `flytekit` to compile Python code into Flyte-compatible definitions and to interact with the Flyte API.
*   **Structured Data Representation**: The models provide strongly typed Python classes for complex Flyte concepts, such as:
    *   **Identifiers**: `Identifier`, `WorkflowExecutionIdentifier`, `TaskExecutionIdentifier`, `NodeExecutionIdentifier` for uniquely identifying entities.
    *   **Types**: `LiteralType`, `SchemaType`, `BlobType`, `StructuredDatasetType`, `UnionType`, `EnumType` for defining data types.
    *   **Literals**: `Literal`, `Scalar`, `Primitive`, `LiteralMap`, `Binding`, `BindingData` for representing actual data values and their connections.
    *   **Tasks and Workflows**: `TaskTemplate`, `WorkflowTemplate`, `Node`, `TaskMetadata`, `WorkflowMetadata` for defining executable logic and graph structures.
    *   **Executions**: `Execution`, `ExecutionSpec`, `ExecutionClosure`, `TaskExecution`, `NodeExecution` for representing runtime instances.
    *   **Configuration**: `Resources`, `AuthRole`, `Labels`, `Annotations`, `Notifications` for specifying runtime behavior and metadata.
*   **Equality and Hashing**: `FlyteIdlEntity` implements `__eq__`, `__ne__`, and `__hash__` based on the underlying protobuf representation. This ensures consistent comparison and hashing of Flyte models.
*   **Debugging Representation**: `short_string()` and `_repr_html_()` methods provide human-readable and Jupyter-friendly representations of the models, aiding in debugging and inspection.
*   **Custom IDL Entities**: `FlyteCustomIdlEntity` extends the base `FlyteIdlEntity` for models that use a custom JSON/dictionary-based serialization instead of direct protobuf, providing `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods.

### Practical Implementation

The `flytekit.models` are the backbone of `flytekit`'s interaction with the Flyte platform.

*   **Compilation**: When a `flytekit` workflow or task is compiled, the Python objects representing the workflow graph, task definitions, and input/output interfaces are converted into their respective Flyte IDL model representations. These protobuf messages are then sent to the Flyte Admin service for registration.
*   **Execution**: During local or remote execution, `flytekit` receives and processes Flyte IDL messages (e.g., execution status updates, input literal maps) by deserializing them into these Python model objects.
*   **API Interaction**: Any interaction with the Flyte Admin gRPC API involves constructing requests using these models and parsing responses back into them.

```python
from flytekit.models.core.identifier import Identifier, ResourceType
from flytekit.models.task import TaskTemplate, TaskMetadata, RuntimeMetadata, Resources, Container
from flytekit.models.interface import TypedInterface, Variable
from flytekit.models.types import LiteralType, SimpleType
from datetime import timedelta

# Create a simple task template model
task_id = Identifier(
    resource_type=ResourceType.TASK,
    project="flyteexamples",
    domain="development",
    name="my_example_task",
    version="1.0.0"
)

task_metadata = TaskMetadata(
    discoverable=True,
    runtime=RuntimeMetadata(type=RuntimeMetadata.RuntimeType.FLYTE_SDK, version="1.0.0", flavor="python"),
    timeout=timedelta(minutes=10),
    retries=0,
    interruptible=False,
    discovery_version="1",
    deprecated_error_message="",
    cache_serializable=False,
    pod_template_name="",
    cache_ignore_input_vars=()
)

task_interface = TypedInterface(
    inputs={"x": Variable(type=LiteralType(simple=SimpleType.INTEGER), description="input x")},
    outputs={"y": Variable(type=LiteralType(simple=SimpleType.INTEGER), description="output y")}
)

container = Container(
    image="my_image:latest",
    command=["python"],
    args=["my_script.py"],
    resources=Resources(requests=[], limits=[]),
    env={},
    config={}
)

task_template = TaskTemplate(
    id=task_id,
    type="python-task",
    metadata=task_metadata,
    interface=task_interface,
    custom={},
    container=container
)

# Convert to Flyte IDL (protobuf)
idl_task_template = task_template.to_flyte_idl()
print(f"Protobuf representation: {idl_task_template}")

# Convert back from Flyte IDL
reconstructed_task_template = TaskTemplate.from_flyte_idl(idl_task_template)
print(f"Reconstructed Python object: {reconstructed_task_template}")

assert task_template == reconstructed_task_template
```

### Important Considerations

*   **Version Compatibility**: The `flytekit.models` package is tightly coupled with the Flyte IDL definitions. Compatibility issues can arise if the SDK version is significantly different from the Flyte Admin service version, as the protobuf schemas might have diverged.
*   **Immutability**: While Python objects are mutable, the underlying protobuf messages are often treated as immutable data contracts. Best practice is to create new model instances for modifications rather than mutating existing ones, especially before serialization.
*   **OneOf Fields**: Many protobuf fields are defined as "oneof," meaning only one of a set of fields can be set at a time. The Python models reflect this by making only one property non-`None` at a time (e.g., `Literal.scalar`, `Literal.collection`, `Literal.map`).
*   **`FlyteIdlEntity` Hashing**: The `__hash__` implementation for `FlyteIdlEntity` relies on the deterministic serialization of the underlying protobuf. This ensures consistent hashing for caching and comparison purposes.
