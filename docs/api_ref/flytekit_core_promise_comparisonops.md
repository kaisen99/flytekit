# ComparisonOps

This class defines a set of comparison operations as an enumeration. It provides symbolic representations for common comparison operators such as equality, inequality, greater than, and less than. This class is designed to be used where symbolic representation of comparison operations is needed.

## Attributes

- **EQ**: string = ==
  - Equal to

- **NE**: string = !=
  - Not equal to

- **GT**: string = &gt;
  - Greater than

- **GE**: string = &gt;=
  - Greater than or equal to

- **LT**: string = &lt;
  - Less than

- **LE**: string = &lt; =
  - Less than or equal to
