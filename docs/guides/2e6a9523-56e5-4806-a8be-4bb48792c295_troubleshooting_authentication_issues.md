# Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

Authentication issues can arise from various points in the authentication lifecycle, from initial credential validation to ongoing token management. Understanding the specific types of errors and their underlying causes is crucial for building robust and resilient applications. This section details common authentication challenges and provides guidance on effective troubleshooting and error handling.

## Understanding Authentication Errors

The system defines specific error types to categorize authentication failures, enabling precise error handling and user feedback. These errors are derived from `RuntimeError`, allowing them to be caught and managed within application logic.

### Handling General Authentication Failures

The `AuthenticationError` is a broad exception raised for any general failure during the authentication process. This includes scenarios where credentials are rejected, the authentication server is unreachable, or an unexpected issue prevents successful authentication.

**Common Causes:**
*   **Invalid Credentials:** Incorrect username, password, or API key.
*   **Account State Issues:** User account is locked, disabled, or requires verification.
*   **Policy Violations:** Authentication attempts that do not meet security policies (e.g., IP restrictions, MFA requirements not met).
*   **Service Unavailability:** The authentication service is temporarily down or unreachable due to network issues.

**Best Practices for Handling:**
When an `AuthenticationError` occurs, it typically indicates that the current authentication attempt has failed and cannot be retried without user intervention or a change in the request.
*   **Log Details:** Capture relevant information (e.g., timestamp, user ID if available, specific error message) for debugging. Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords.
*   **User Feedback:** Inform the user clearly about the failure, suggesting common remedies like checking credentials or contacting support.
*   **Re-authentication:** Prompt the user to re-enter credentials or restart the authentication flow.

**Example:**

```python
from my_auth_module import authenticate, AuthenticationError

try:
    # Attempt to authenticate a user
    user_session = authenticate(username="testuser", password="wrongpassword")
    print("Authentication successful!")
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
    # Log the error for internal review
    # logger.error(f"Authentication failed for user 'testuser': {e}")
    # Inform the user to check their credentials
    print("Please check your username and password and try again.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred during authentication: {e}")
```

### Addressing Missing or Expired Access Tokens

The `AccessTokenNotFoundError` is raised when an expected access token is not found, is invalid, or when the process of refreshing an expired token fails. This error is critical for managing session validity and ensuring continuous authorized access to resources.

**Common Causes:**
*   **Initial Token Acquisition Failure:** The application failed to obtain an access token after a successful login.
*   **Token Expiration:** The access token has expired, and the refresh token (if used) is either missing, invalid, or has also expired.
*   **Refresh Mechanism Failure:** Network issues, invalid refresh token, or server-side problems prevent the successful exchange of a refresh token for a new access token.
*   **Token Revocation:** The access token or refresh token has been explicitly revoked by the authentication server.

**Recovery Strategies:**
When an `AccessTokenNotFoundError` occurs, the application typically cannot proceed with authorized requests. The primary recovery strategy is to re-initiate the full authentication flow.
*   **Clear Session Data:** Remove any stale or invalid tokens from local storage.
*   **Redirect to Login:** Guide the user back to the login page or re-authentication prompt.
*   **Inform User:** Explain that their session has expired or is invalid and they need to log in again.

**Example:**

```python
from my_auth_module import get_resource, refresh_token, AccessTokenNotFoundError

def fetch_data_with_retry(resource_id):
    try:
        data = get_resource(resource_id)
        print(f"Successfully fetched data: {data}")
        return data
    except AccessTokenNotFoundError:
        print("Access token not found or refresh failed. Attempting re-authentication...")
        try:
            # This would typically involve redirecting the user to a login flow
            # For demonstration, assume a re-login function exists
            re_authenticate_user()
            # After re-authentication, retry fetching the resource
            data = get_resource(resource_id)
            print(f"Successfully fetched data after re-authentication: {data}")
            return data
        except AuthenticationError as e:
            print(f"Re-authentication failed: {e}. User must log in manually.")
            # Handle user logout or redirect to login page
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

def re_authenticate_user():
    # Placeholder for a function that initiates a full re-authentication flow
    # This might involve opening a browser for OAuth, or prompting for credentials
    print("Initiating full user re-authentication process...")
    # Simulate a successful re-authentication for demonstration
    # In a real app, this would involve user interaction and token acquisition
    print("User re-authenticated successfully (simulated).")

# Simulate a scenario where the token is initially missing or invalid
# For example, if get_resource internally calls a token check and fails
# get_resource("some_data_id") # This call would raise AccessTokenNotFoundError
```

### Managing Pending Authentication States

The `AuthenticationPending` error is raised when the authentication process has been initiated but requires further action from the user or an external system before it can complete. This is common in multi-step authentication flows, such as device authorization flows or multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenges.

**Common Scenarios:**
*   **Device Authorization Flow:** A user initiates login on a device (e.g., smart TV) and is prompted to approve the login on another device (e.g., phone). The initial device polls for completion.
*   **MFA Challenge:** After entering credentials, the user needs to approve a push notification, enter a code from an authenticator app, or respond to an SMS.

**Polling and User Experience:**
When `AuthenticationPending` is encountered, the application should typically:
*   **Inform the User:** Provide clear instructions on what action is required (e.g., "Please approve the login request on your mobile device").
*   **Implement Polling:** Periodically re-attempt the authentication check until it succeeds or a timeout occurs.
*   **Implement Timeout:** Set a reasonable timeout for the pending state. If the timeout is reached, the authentication attempt should be considered failed, and the user should be informed.

**Example:**

```python
import time
from my_auth_module import initiate_device_auth, check_device_auth_status, AuthenticationPending, AuthenticationError

def perform_device_authentication():
    try:
        device_code_info = initiate_device_auth()
        print(f"Please go to {device_code_info['verification_uri']} and enter code: {device_code_info['user_code']}")

        polling_interval = device_code_info.get('interval', 5) # Default to 5 seconds
        timeout = 300 # 5 minutes timeout

        start_time = time.time()
        while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
            try:
                session_token = check_device_auth_status(device_code_info['device_code'])
                print("Device authentication successful!")
                return session_token
            except AuthenticationPending:
                print(f"Authentication pending... Waiting {polling_interval} seconds.")
                time.sleep(polling_interval)
            except AuthenticationError as e:
                print(f"Device authentication failed: {e}")
                return None
        print("Device authentication timed out. Please try again.")
        return None
    except AuthenticationError as e:
        print(f"Failed to initiate device authentication: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# session = perform_device_authentication()
# if session:
#     print(f"Obtained session token: {session}")
```

## Common Troubleshooting Steps

Beyond specific error handling, several general practices can aid in diagnosing and resolving authentication issues:

*   **Review Logs:** Comprehensive logging of authentication attempts, including timestamps, user identifiers, and specific error messages, is invaluable for post-mortem analysis.
*   **Verify Network Connectivity:** Ensure the application can reach the authentication server. Network issues (DNS resolution, firewalls, proxy settings) are common culprits.
*   **Check Credentials and Configuration:** Double-check all configured credentials (client IDs, secrets, API keys) and authentication endpoints for correctness.
*   **Time Synchronization:** Ensure that the system clock of the application server is synchronized. Time differences can cause issues with token validation (e.g., `nbf` - not before, `exp` - expiration claims in JWTs).
*   **Inspect Token Contents:** If tokens are obtained, but issues persist, decode and inspect the contents of JWTs (if applicable) to verify claims like expiration, audience, and issuer.
*   **Test with Known Good Credentials:** Isolate the problem by attempting authentication with credentials known to be valid.
